Text Catezoriation and Summarization
Text categorization and summarization are two important natural language processing tasks that aim to extract meaningful information from large amounts of textual data.

Text categorization involves classifying a given text into one or more predefined categories based on its content. This is typically done using machine learning algorithms that learn from annotated training data. Text categorization is widely used in various applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and news classification.

Text summarization, on the other hand, involves generating a shorter version of a given text while preserving its key information. There are two main types of summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting the most important sentences from the original text and concatenating them to form a summary. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text. Text summarization has a wide range of applications such as news summarization, document summarization, and chatbot response generation.
